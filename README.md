Curve fitting algorithm using Genetic Algorithm

Given a set of data, is there a formula behind it that matches closely and can be used for prediction?
Standard Analytic models can come close to the prediction but the formula is unknown.
Genetic Algorithm on the other hand, the formula can be extracted after trainning and applied for prediction! The coefficient change history can be collected over time for tier 2 deeper analysis.

Below is a fast forward version of a GA run::
