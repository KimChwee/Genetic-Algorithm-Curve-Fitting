Curve fitting algorithm using Genetic Algorithm

Given a set of data, is there a formula behind it that matches closely and can be used for prediction?
Neural Network can come close to the predict but the formula cannot be extracted after training
Genetic Algorithm on the other hand, the formula can be extracted after trainning and applied for prediction!

Below is a fast forward version of a GA run::
